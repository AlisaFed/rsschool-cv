## **Briefly about myself:**
I started my career as a trainee in Python programming courses conducted by Stepik. After finishing the courses with a grade of 100% I decided to continue my journey in programming by studying Git, GitHub and Jenkins. 

When I started learning JavaScript my knowledge of Git and Jenkins was very helpful with my pet project. I was really excited about JavaScript and was spending all my spare time learning, reading books and writing code.

Finished JavaScript/Front-end 2022Q1 course at RSschool. Have experience working in a team on the final project of the course.  

I am very keen on web development and doing my best to become a seasoned JavaScript developer.

#### **Code example:**
The makeLooper() function (make_looper in Python) takes a string (of non-zero length) as an argument. It returns a function. The function it returns will return successive characters of the string on successive invocations. It will start back at the beginning of the string once it reaches the end:
``` JavaScript
function makeLooper(str) {
  let elem = 0;
  return function() {
    let answer = str[elem%str.length];
    elem++;
    return answer;
  }
}
```
